When running in debug mode, often silent exceptions occur when performing the web search. But exceptions also occur in other very common actions. Searching with google scholar, sometimes a message shows up that the maximum amount of queries has been reached, then nothing works any more. Better tagging of references should be possible. Grouping references needs major improvements and should be possible more intuitively. The performance of JabRef's interface in not that good, it is a bit lagging. Even switching between the menus on top is slow, which should not be the case. Fetching references of identifiers (like DOI, ISBN) needs improvement. Managing and handling file attachments is unnecessarily clumsy. There should be more hints (e.g. popups) how the input for a field should be formatted. More feedback should be provided about what is wrong with an input. Maybe some example would also be useful. Searching the library should be improved.
